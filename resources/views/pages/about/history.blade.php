                                    The Technological University of the Philippines was first established as the Manila
                                    Trade School in 1901 upon the enactment of Act No. 74 by the United States Philippine
                                    Commission for the instruction of the Filipinos on useful trades. Originally housed near
                                    Ateneo de Manila in Intramuros, MTS transferred to the Exposicion Regional de Filipinos
                                    in Calle Padre Faura. Six years later, the MTS transferred to the City Shops in Calle
                                    Arroceros.

                                    because pupils at that time were already adults. They were studying certain trades which
                                    they intended to follow after leaving school.

                                    In 1910, the MTS was renamed as the Philippine School of Arts and Trades (PSAT). It
                                    started to offer intermediate grade courses. The primary school level was then phased
                                    out because the ages of pupils were younger now than in 1901. With the growing student
                                    population at that time, PSAT relocated in 1916 to a 36,000 square meter property as its
                                    new campus site under Lot 1 Block 1485 Cad. 13, Manila Cadastre, located in Ermita,
                                    Manila bounded on northeast by Calle San Marcelino; on southeast by Estero Balete; and
                                    on northwest by Ayala Boulevard. Since then, this became the site of the TUP Main
                                    campus.
                                </p>
                                <p class="flow-text" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8;">
                                    In 1915, PSAT was authorized to offer a secondary level curriculum and in 1927, it was
                                    classified as a full secondary level school. The intermediate grades were completely
                                    abolished and new courses, practical electricity and marine engineering, were offered.
                                    In 1928, PSAT piloted the first two-year college courses for industrial teachers and
                                    skilled workers and, in 1934, it was formally organized. In 1937, PSAT was formally
                                    classified as a junior college with two departments: teacher education and technical
                                    education. In 1941, the school closed because of the Pacific War of World War II. After
                                    the war in 1945, PSAT reopened and accommodated (1949) Dr. Frederick Leasure, the first
                                    Fulbright exchange professor and a professor of industrial education. In 1951, PSAT was
                                    granted authority to offer a four-year degree leading to BS in Industrial Education.
                                    This was a first among schools.

                                    baccalaureate and graduate degrees. This enabled the College to pioneer the offering of

                                    1959-1960.
